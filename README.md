# Clinic-Reservation-Application

A sophisticated Android application developed to manage clinic reservations and user roles effectively. Built in Java, this app features a robust backend powered by Firebase and supports multiple user roles with tailored functionalities.

## Overview
The app was designed to simplify clinic operations by enabling admins, doctors, and patients to manage reservations and clinic-related activities. It supports role-based access, ensuring each user type has the appropriate level of control. While the app was nearly completed, development was halted due to financial constraints from the client.

## Notes
This project demonstrates my ability to implement role-based access control, integrate Firebase services, and design user-friendly Android applications. Though incomplete, it highlights strong technical and architectural skills.
